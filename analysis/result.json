        "body": "It is an anti-evasion measure which will benefit the country, says Jaitley\n\nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while explaining why he had linked Aadhaar with PAN said on Wednesday that some people have multiple PAN cards and are using it as a tool for tax evasion.\n\n\"Aadhaar has biometric details, so its chances of misuse become minimal. When the country has so much technology, and when it is being put to use, why create such a hue and cry about it? It is an anti-evasion measure which will benefit the country. So the government considers it right to implement it,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, Jaitley said that the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had been conceptualised by the previous UPA dispensation and the NDA government is putting it to use with 98 per cent adults or more than 108 crore people in India have been issued Aadhaar numbers.\n\n\"We have kept a provision that a person who does not have Aadhaar can say 'I have applied for Aadhaar.' We can't allow people to say I will not make Aadhaar, but through multiple PAN cards will continue to evade taxes,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Bill came up for discussion and Jaitley faced some tough questioning before the Lok Sabha passed the Bill, with 40 amendments.\n\nThe Opposition members fiercely protested the government's move to tag non-tax bills with the Finance Bill and described it a \"backdoor entry\" to classify them as money bills, which don't require the approval of the Rajya Sabha, where government is in a minority.\n\nTempers flared up in the Lok Sabha on the government's move to make the Aadhaar card mandatory to file income-tax returns from July 1 to check tax evasion, as well as to apply for a permanent account number.\n\nThis move has also been introduced in the Financial Bill. Members from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) Bhartruhari Mahtab questioned the government's move \"forcing\" the people to have Aadhaar number which they said went against the Supreme Court directions. Just before the Bill was passed, BJD members staged a walkout.\n\nThe Finance Bill has also lowered the cash transaction limit from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 2 lakh from April 1. The Bill includes amendments to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, Companies Act, Employees' Provident Fund Act, Information Technology Act, Smuggling and Foreign Exchange Act and a host other laws.\n\nAsked to respond on the issue of remonetization, Jaitley said that the process was still going on. \"But through data mining, the CBDT and the income-tax department have found out from the first-cut analysis that cash deposited by 18 lakh people did not match with their income profile,\" he said.\n\nThe authorities had sought explanation from these 18 lakh entities through SMS and emails, he added. Jaitley also rejected charges of bypassing the Rajya House by incorporating amendments to various Acts into the Finance Bill.\n\nHe said that these were mere clarifications and rationalisations and cited that there were 40 judicial tribunals governed by various laws, with difference in pay, remuneration and work structures. The law has now brought parity and merged various tribunals to save the exchequer's money.",

The state has an Aadhaar penetration of about six per cent, owing to the intertwining issues of citizenship and illegal immigration.\n\nAs of November 15, 2016, only 18,16,459 of Assam's 3,11,69,272 citizens had Aadhar cards. When registration booths for Aadhaar cards were mushrooming in the country, there was a demand from to stop them in Assam.\n\nThe All Assam Students Union (AASU), who has been univocally demanding a resolution to the issue of the upgradation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), opposed Aadhaars in the state saying that several undocumented people will become citizens through the card.\n\nSpeaking to DNA, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that the state administration is now discussing ways to ensure Aadhaar cards for everyone before the December 31 deadline.\n\n\"We have also discussed the matter with the Centre. Assam is a sensitive state, with international borders, and we will need to work out ways to safeguards the interests of the people. It needs to be a gradual process,\" said Sonowal.\n\nAASU, however, said that they will write to the Home ministry to immediately stop the registration of Aadhar cards in Assam. \"In cases where the NRC is relying on Aadhaar data in Assam, we want the Centre to delete it from the register. The case is pending in the Supreme Court, and our demand is that the cut-off date should remain at 1971, not later,\" said AASU President Dipanko Kumar Nath.\n\nAs per the notifications sent out by several ministries, the deadline for several crucial social schemes like pension, midday meals for school-children, cash benefits for the differently-abled, cash benefits for food grains, honorarium for teachers, self-employment schemes for women and adult teachers, etc is June 30, 2017. While for some other schemes, such as scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students, compensation for contractual labours engaged in government work, ASHA workers, etc., the deadline ends on March 31, 2017.\n\nIn Assam, a few unauthorised centres were registering people under Aadhaar. In the last few weeks, the state government has taken up a some centres in Nagaon, Golaghat and Sonitpur district as a pilot project.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi from Kaliabor, raised the issue of 48 lakh married women in the state who will be left in the lurch after a recent Gauhati High Court judgment invalidated panchayati certificates as citizenship documents.\n\n\"This is gross injustice against women. The usage of panchayat certificates has been approved by the MHA itself, by the Registrar General India and the Census Commissioner,\" Gogoi said.\n\nSpeaking to DNA, Gogoi said the matter directly affects the women, several of whom are poor and helpless. \"Personally, we feel that by creating this legal ambiguity, the important NRC process is being jeopardised, and eventually the deadline pushed. This is a result of the ulterior motives of the BJP government, because it plans to bring in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to allow Bangladeshi Hindus to move to Assam,\" Gogoi said.",

        "body": "'The government that is talking all the time about national security and national interests should be concerned.'\n\n'When national interests are jeopardised by their own project, they should pause and listen.'\n\n'Whether it is the BJP or the Congress, they all want control over the people.'\n\n'They don't give a damn if anything happens to the people of the country; they are only interested in what they can get out of the data.'\n\nIllustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com\n\nDr Usha Ramanathan, an independent legal researcher, has been writing, campaigning and debating the social, legal and economic aspects of the Aadhar card project from 2009 onwards.\n\nDr Ramanathan, below, left, tells Rediff.com's Shobha Warrier why Aadhar is not going to help India or its people in any way, rather how it is a security threat.\n\nYou have been a strong critic of the Aadhar card from the time it was introduced by the Manmohan Singh government. The way the Narendra Modi government is making it an all-encompassing identity card, do the people of India have to be worried?\n\nYou have to remember that this is not just a project of the government; it is a project of corporate interests which is working with and through the government.\n\nIncreasingly, it has become clear that this isn't just about India, the Indian government and the Indian State.\n\nWe now know that the curiosity of the American establishment is very high in what is happening in various parts of the world.\n\nWe also know that with the kind of economic development that is happening, there are many countries that are interested in India, interested in the various kinds of data points which would help them decide where they want to intervene and where they don't want to.\n\nFrom what's happening around the world, we know that the curiosity is more than we can tolerate.\n\nWe also know that the UPA (Dr Singh's United Progressive Alliance) government wanted us to believe that they were at least dealing with terrorism.\n\nWe have been saying from the beginning that when you are creating a data base of this kind of the entire population, it is a national security threat.\n\nI don't understand how the government does not see it.\n\nWe had breaches happening to data bases all over the place.\n\nThe craziness of the data base is that they say you put the number in every data base, which is what the corporates want.\n\nThey want to make data out of all of us.\n\nThey are asking us to put three numbers everywhere: Bank account number, UID number and mobile number.\n\nThese are the ways you identify yourself in various places and now you make that completely insecure because it's all over the place.\n\nNow they want to put biometrics also everywhere. So, it's a system without a system.\n\nNandan Nilekani, then the chairman of the Unique Identity Authority of India, had said it was an identity platform, but now it has become an identity itself...\n\nIt was never meant to be an identity. It was meant to be an identity platform and he doesn't care what happens to the identity of the person.\n\nHe just wants numbers that can track various kinds of data which they are interested in.\n\nThat's why Nilekani says privacy is not an issue, surveillance is not an issue, and India, from being a data poor country is becoming a data rich country.\n\nWhat he says will happen because everybody will have to leave their digital footprints in different places for different service providers, and that's his plan.\n\nHis is a complete corporate plan where data is the new oil and he wants to be in total control of the whole pipeline of the data.\n\nWhen Aadhar was first introduced Nilekani had said that biometric data would not be given to anybody. Now, even a private telephone company is using the same biometrics to identify you.\n\nHow dangerous is it going to be?\n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that Nilekani has been misinforming throughout.\n\nFor instance, he says UIDAI does not give biometric information as it does not have much information, so it's not unsafe.\n\nYes, UIDAI might not give biometric information, but in the process of accessing their authentication service, they are handing over to people whatever is in their data base.\n\nNow they are using biometrics to be the authenticator by all kinds of people which means you have no control over it.\n\nThere is no monitoring system to verify that they are not retaining the biometric, there is no monitoring system to ensure that the consent is being got. Nothing.\n\nThe only conclusion I can draw is that they don't give a damn if anything happens to the people of the country; they are only interested in what they can get out of the data.\n\nIs it necessary for every citizen of a country to have a unique ID number?\n\nIf you look at the various uses for which they are going to put it, we see two kinds of users.\n\nOne is, private companies want to use it so that they KYC will become simpler.\n\nBy creating such a data base with so much resources, putting all people at risk so that your KYC becomes simpler is completely disproportionate to my mind.\n\nThen they say the government will be able to deliver services, but if you see, so far they have used it only to cut people out of services and not to deliver services.\n\nIf you look at all the notifications that are coming now, it is impossible to understand what possible purpose there can be.\n\nFor example, if you are going to have a toilet in your house and they are going to give money for that, you have to give your UID number before you get the money.\n\nIf you are a Bhopal gas victim from 1984 and for rehabilitation, today you have to give your UID number, or else, you get dis-entitled for rehabilitation.\n\nIf you are a woman rescued from prostitution and rehabilitated, they ask her to give her UID number which is completely contradictory because the first thing such a rehabilitation needs is anonymity.\n\nWhen a manual scavenger is rehabilitated, he doesn't want to carry the identity with him. But it appears nobody cares.\n\nThey only want you to have a UID number and put it on every data base.\n\nIt's one way of coercing people to enrol for this. That's contrary to the orders of the court, but it appears the government doesn't give a damn what the court is saying or anybody's saying or what even their own lawyers are saying.\n\nEven the law says only two kinds of use is possible; one is authentication which means you give a fingerprint, but nobody can retain the data but that's not what is happening.\n\nThe second thing is, they have added e-KYC, an app created on the platform to give information which is against what they said when it was created.\n\nThe most important thing is, they are asking us to put the number in every database.\n\nShow me the provision in the law that allows them to do so.\n\nThe law says you cannot retain the information. They don't have a provision which says you can ask for the number anywhere.\n\nActually it is contrary to the law the government itself has made in a hurried way calling it a Money Bill.\n\nForget about the court, they are breaking their own law.\n\nIs it not in a way intruding into the lives of people?\n\nObviously. If you are a Bhopal gas victim, or a prostitute or a manual scavenger, you are able to track them and this is something that intrudes into the lives of people.\n\nThe HRD ministry said they are going to put the UID number with the school from the time the child enters school till he leaves.\n\nSociologically this is the age they pass through many conflicts and problems in life and emerge into adulthood.\n\nNow, they are saying they would add the number to everything.\n\nThe HRD ministry says they can give the data (of children) to employers later. Are they going to give information to an employer what a child went through on his way to adulthood? Who is this employer?\n\nLike you said earlier, is it like the corporates and the market matter more than the individuals?\n\nFor people like Nilekani, they are only interested in the market as they want to have more start-ups and they want to outsource. This is the only agenda they know.\n\nFor the government, they have found a convenient tool to put people under surveillance and tracking people across time and activities.\n\nWhy is the Bill Gates Foundation coming and sitting with the RBI every day asking them to make everything cashless?\n\nAnd they have not tested any of these systems and wherever they have tested, the system has failed. But they are refusing to say what the tests have shown.\n\nTo me, there seems to be concerted plan to attack our various systems and one of the central systems is the monetary system.\n\nWe see a lot of irresponsibility here.\n\nNilekani and his people create whatever apps they want and they say they evangelise them to the government.\n\nThe government is not listening to other people, calling us anti-UIDAI.\n\nThis is not about anti-UIDAI; this is a stupid system.\n\nIn 2010, we had said, please pause before you carry on. Get the feasibility report done as this is what we anticipate.\n\nNow what we had anticipated has happened; coercion, illegality and exclusion.\n\nWhen you give it to companies of all kinds, it becomes a national security threat too.\n\nThe government that is talking all the time about national security and national interests should be concerned.\n\nWho is Paytm? Why do we have to reveal everything, all our financial transactions to Paytm?\n\nThe idea that people are irrelevant and relevant only as data points will lead us down to very dangerous paths.\n\nHow is it useful for the government to expose every single person?\n\nWhat does the government want?\n\nIf the government wants to administer, this is not the way to do it.\n\nIf the government wants to track and profile people, this can, to quite an extent, be a good surveillance.\n\nBut the government has to be concerned about national security and national interests.\n\nWhen national interests are jeopardised by their own project, they should pause and listen.\n\nYou have created multiple electronic data bases now. Do you think other countries are not going to dig into this? How can they be so na\u00efve?\n\nThey said UIDAI numbers were issued to 80 crore people and 8 crore enrolments were rejected, which is 10 per cent of the enrolment.\n\nWhen we asked why they were rejected, they said there were duplicates. But they do not know how many were duplicates and for what other reasons they were rejected.\n\nThey were not bothered to go back and check.\n\nYou ask the biometric experts, they would say it won't take much time to create fake numbers. The enrolment is done by some agency, not even monitored well.\n\nCreating multiple fake identities is so easy in this process.\n\nWhat is the value of something when 30 per cent people in Rajasthan cannot get ration because their fingerprints are not there?\n\nI can understand Nilekani being irresponsible because for him, he only wants to control this as it is a corporate interest. But how can the government be doing this?\n\nThe supporters of the unique number say that in countries like the US, there is a unique ID number for everyone and they ask, why is it that in India people want to criticise it...\n\nFirst of all, what the US has is a social security number and there is no comparison between the US social security number and this (the way the government want to use the Aadhar ID).\n\nIn the US, the social security number is linked to social security, but here this ID is linked to all and sundry; from the mid-day meal scheme to everything.\n\nHere, the State is saying, 'if I give you something, if I pay you a salary, you are the beneficiary of the State, and therefore, you have to be subservient to the State.'\n\nIn the US, they will allow it to be used only for limited purposes and they advise you not to use it everywhere.\n\nThey have the privacy law, the non-discrimination law and they have a system by which you can complain if you have a problem. And it's not based on biometrics.\n\nNow that the government plans to connect all the details of a person like income tax, driving license, etc to the Aadhar card, do you feel it's going to be like Big Brother watching us all?\n\nObviously. What does the government say? All of you are corrupt unless you prove otherwise.\n\nThey even say they will cancel you PAN card if you don't have an Aadhar card. How absurd is that?\n\nIf you look at the past 15 years, where have all the scams happened? Within the government and between the governments and corporates. But they want to check us and see whether we are corrupt or not.\n\nThis has nothing to do with corruption, efficiency, inclusiveness, etc. All these myths are busted by now.\n\nWhy do you have a Constitution?\n\nBecause you want to recognise your rights and you want the State to be restrained.\n\nIt's not about making the State all powerful; it's about controlling the power of the State.\n\nNow the State says, I am above the law and I will do whatever I want.\n\nIf you want to be recognised as a human being in this territory, you better do what I ask you to do.\n\nThey have the power to disable and omit any number.\n\nThe Manmohan Singh government started it with the intention of cutting down on subsidies because the World Bank was asking them to cut it down to the maximum.\n\nThis government which in Opposition wanted the project to be dropped because it was insecure, is going on with it.\n\nThey said the first thing they would do when they come to power would be to scrap the project.\n\nAfter they came to power, they want power over people.\n\nIt's tragic that two governments that follow different ideologies, are doing the same.\n\nThis is like keeping the RTI upside down.\n\nRTI was about the State visible to people, but this is about making people visible to the State.\n\nThere is an ambition in the government that everyone should be in every data base to be completely visible to the State.\n\nThat is the biggest threat to the democracy you can have.\n\nThe State has the power and not the people.\n\nPeople have to worry about the State having too much power.\n\nThis is a clear case of moving towards absolute power with the State.\n\nThe State wants each individual to come and prove at regular intervals that s/he is not corrupt.\n\nIt is like, I as the State need to see you whenever I want to.\n\nWhen in power, whether it is the BJP or the Congress, they all want control over the people.\n\nIt is the job of the court to see that they don't get the control over people.\n\nBecause this is not an anarchic country; the government is taking advantage of it.\n\nThe court also has to realise that the State is not the protector of civil liberties; it is the court.\n\nOur fundamental rights are not protected by the State, but by the court.\n\nThe court has to understand that people depend upon the court to protect them from the absolute power of the State.\n\nIf the court abandons that role, people will have to find other means which is not a good thing.",

The downloaded data will be embedded with the bar-coded Aadhar number of the users.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have approximately 5,000 open series maps, out of which 3,000 would be available immediately. Another 700, mostly related to land boundary, would also come up after we received approval from the government,\u201d Swarna Subba Rao, Surveyor General of India said here on Monday.\n\n\n\nAccessing these maps currently involves a trip to one of the Survey of India\u2019s 23 branch offices, where these topography-sheets are sold against identity proof. In the portal (www.soinakshe.uk.gov.in), the maps would be available free.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a law that states any information compiled with the public money should readily be available to the people. That\u2019s why I suggested to them to open up the maps for the public,\u201d said union science minister Harsh Vardhan.\n\n\n\nIn a policy change, the mapping organisation from now on would provide its data free to the government agencies including the state government, said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, department of science and technology on the sidelines of a function to celebrate Survey of India\u2019s 250th anniversary.\n\n\n\nSince its inception in 1767, Survey of India prepares two series of maps \u2013 open series maps for the general public and defence series maps for the military. The open series maps (1: 50,000 scale) would be made available online.\n\n\n\nThe mapping organisation has also made a gravity-based mathematical formula to calculate the elevation with respect to the mean sea level, using GPS data. This is called IndeGeoid (Geoid model of India), absence of which was considered a major bottleneck for engineering projects.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeGeoid would help reduce the turn-around time for engineering projects, reducing the project cost,\u201d Lt Col Kunal Borkar, assistant surveyor general told DH.\n\n\n\nUsing this mathematical formula, the height of any structure can be calculated with an accuracy of up to 30 cm. The scientists planed to bring it down to 10 cm of accuracy by 2018, he said.",

        "body": "Highly placed official sources told The Assam Tribune that a small portion of the people of Assam received Aadhar cards after a pilot project was launched in three districts. But the pilot project has also been suspended.\n\nSources said that in 2012, the Government of India decided that in a few sensitive states, the enrolment for issuing Aadhar cards would be done by the Registrar General of India and forward it to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) for generating the Aadhar number and issuing cards, while, in the other states, the UIDAI was authorized to do both the enrolment and issuing cards. However, as the process became slow, the Government decided to entrust the UIDAI to carry out both the jobs.\n\nSources revealed that the process is yet to start formally in Assam as the State Government is of the view that it should start only after the completion of the NRC updating process. A pilot project was started in the districts of Nagaon, Sonitpur and Golaghat but later that too has been suspended. However, Aadhar cards have been issued to the Government employees posted in the State Secretariat, while, some senior officers of the Government also got the cards. The Central Government employees posted in the State also received the Aadhar cards. According to records available, around 6.6 per cent of the total population of the State based on projected population figure of 2015 now have Aadhar cards.\n\nThe process is also slow in Meghalaya and up to the end of March this year, only around nine per cent of the projected population of 2015 of the state received Aadhar cards. Sources said that the process in Meghalaya slowed down because a strong students\ufffd body of the state objected to issuing Aadhar cards. The actual process in the state began only recently after the students\ufffd body agreed to allow issuing cards.\n\nBut the progress is satisfactory in other states of the region. According to records available, the progress is the highest in Tripura among the North East states. According to records available, 94.4 per cent of the total population of the state received Aadhar cards up to the end of March this year. This is followed closely by Sikkim where 92.6 per cent of the population received cards. Around 68.8 per cent of population of Manipur received Aadhar cards, 65.3 per cent in Arunachal Pradesh, 55.5 per cent in Nagaland and 62.3 per cent of the population received cards in Mizoram.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that the Central Government has made Aadhar cards mandatory for banks accounts, LPG connections etc. However, Assam is exempted as Aadhar cards are yet to be issued to common people of the State.",

        "body": "New Delhi: Amid a raging debate over cow vigilantism, the Central government has now proposed to give a unique identification numbers to cows in India. According to ANI, the Centre has made his proposal to the Supreme Court. In its report to Supreme court, the Central government has said, \"Each cow and its progeny across India should get a Unique Identification Number for tracking.\" The central government has also recommended special care for cattle beyond age of milking, while stressing on launching of a scheme for distressed farmers According to an Indian Express report, nearly one lakh technicians have started to fan out across the country since New Year`s Day, armed with 50,000 tablets and a single mission - to affix a tag with a 12-digit unique identification number inside an ear of each of a staggering 88 million cows and buffaloes within this year. The purpose, as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi`s vision, is to tag and track cattle so that they are vaccinated on time and scientific intervention is made available for better breeding and increasing milk production, doubling income of dairy farmers in the process by 2022. The technicians have been trained to affix a polyurethane tag inside the ears of the cattle with a tag applicator. The tag is tamper-proof, cannot be opened by a wrench and is designed to last for years, officials said. Affixing the tag is a meticulous job, an official said, explaining that the yellow-coloured tag with two parts has to be fixed with the help of a tool in the centre of the ear lobe.\u00a0 The tag made from thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer, costing Rs. 8 apiece, weighs just eight grams to cause minimum inconvenience to the animal, the official said. Once the tag is fixed, the technician will use a tablet to update the number in an online database and also provide the cattle owner with an `animal health card` recording the UID number, owner`s details, status of periodic deworming and vaccinations of the animal as well as breeding details.This will help track the cattle along with all relevant details. The Centre has set aside Rs 148 crore for procuring the tags, tag applicators, tablets and health cards, officials said. It has also fixed targets for individual states to be completed within 2017.",

They should pay us on the basis of transactions. It (the proposal) would be out approximately in one month,\" he said.\n\nThe ATMs can be started in the 4,500 departmental buildings and the India Post Payment Bank (IPPB) is also working on having tie-ups with others, he said.\n\nThe IPPB, started with an initial capital of Rs 800 crore, has so far opened two branches at Ranchi and Raipur.\n\nSudhakar said 650 branches of IPPB would be opened with one being set up in every district by September 2017.\n\nThe IPPB would primarily focus on financial inclusion, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and third party products.\n\nThe IPPB would emphasise on \"door-step banking,\" he said while expressing hope that the payment bank would be a \"game- changer in rural economy.\"\n\nNoting that the Department of Posts has been aggressively pursuing financial inclusion by encouraging people to open savings accounts in post offices, he said the number of accounts increased from 33.03 crore in 2014-15 to 35.17 crore in 2016-17 upto February 2017.\n\n\"Rs 7.02 lakh crore is the outstanding balance in all these (35.17 crore) accounts.

The gap in expenditure and revenue is around Rs 6,000 crore.\n\nObserving that the expenditure is expected to rise in 2017 due to the implementation of the Pay Commission, he said the department would be able to make up for the deficit due to the new services.\n\nHe said 978 stand-alone ATMs have been installed at different post offices in the country and they have been made inter-operable from December 31, 2016.\n\nIndia Post has worked with UIDAI to issue Aadhar cards through post offices and the service would commence from June 2017, Sudhakar added.",

The Centre yesterday defended in the apex court its decision of making Aadhar mandatory for PAN and also for filing tax returns, citing that it was done to curb the use of fake PAN cards across the country.      Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohtagi told the division bench of the apex court headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri that the Central Government was entitled to have identification and people couldn't claim immunity from it.      \"There are safeguards for privacy under the Aadhar Act. Under the act the authority shall ensure security, confidentiality of data,\" Rohtagi said.      He further said that the government also records data for death, birth and marriage and also for issuance of driver's license.      \"People can't refuse to furnish data for driving license to argue that government shouldn't collect data for purposes of people who are travelling,\" Rohtagi argued.      The apex court was hearing the petition challenging the government's decision of making Aadhaar mandatory for PAN and also for filing tax returns.      The AG, top law officer representing the Central Government, argued the matter on the point of Section 139AA, inserted in the Income Tax Act under the Finance Act, 2017.      Earlier, the apex court had rapped the government for making Aadhaar compulsory for filing Income Tax returns.      It referred to its order in 2015 when the apex court had made the Aadhaar optional.      Referring to this, the court said, \"How can you make Aadhaar card mandatory when we have passed an order to make it optional?\"      The Attorney General argued that mandatory Aadhaar was the only way to check black money.      The court earlier on March 27 specified that the Aadhaar card should not be made mandatory for availing governmental schemes.      In a violation of the apex court's order, the Centre introduced last-minute amendments to the Finance Bill 2017, making Aadhaar mandatory for filing taxes.",
